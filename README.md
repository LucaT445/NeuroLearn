### Overview

NeuroLearn is an interactive tool for learning brain anatomy. 
It features a color-coded 3D model of the human brain showing each region's functions, location, and associated disorders, and a built-in AI Q&A system to explore related topics beyond the model. It is designed for students, self-learners, and educators.
